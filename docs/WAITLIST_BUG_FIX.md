# Waitlist Bug Fix - Pending Booking Conflict Issue

## Problem Summary

When attempting to create a waitlist booking, the system was only creating `cart_transactions` and `cart_items` entries, but NOT creating entries in `booking_waitlists` table.

## Root Cause

### The Bug

The conflict detection logic in `CartController.php` was too restrictive:

**Scenario that caused the bug:**
1. Admin creates a booking with `status='pending'` (not yet approved)
2. Regular user tries to book the same time slot
3. System checks if the existing booking should trigger a waitlist
4. Waitlist was ONLY triggered if the existing booking is from a **regular user**
5. Since the existing booking is from an **admin**, no waitlist was created
6. The system also didn't reject the booking because it checked if the user role was 'user' before waitlisting
7. **Result**: Regular user saw "Waitlist Failed" error instead of being added to waitlist!

### The Logic Flaw

```php
// OLD CODE (BUGGY)
if ($conflictingBooking &&
    $conflictingBooking->status === 'pending' &&
    $conflictingBooking->payment_status === 'unpaid') {
    $bookingUser = $conflictingBooking->user;
    if ($bookingUser && $bookingUser->role === 'user') {  // ← Only triggers for regular users!
        $isPendingApprovalBooking = true;
    }
}
```

**The Problem:**
- Waitlist was ONLY triggered if the **existing booking owner** was a regular user
- If an admin had a pending booking, the waitlist check would fail
- Result: "Waitlist Failed" error shown to users

**Expected Behavior:**
- ANY pending booking (admin or regular user) should allow NEW users to be waitlisted
- Only APPROVED bookings should reject new bookings outright
- Admin privilege is that ADMINS can bypass being waitlisted, but their pending bookings don't prevent others from joining the waitlist

## The Fix

Modified `app/Http/Controllers/Api/CartController.php` to trigger waitlist for **ANY pending booking**, regardless of who owns it:

### Change 1: Waitlist for any pending booking

```php
// NEW CODE (FIXED)
if ($conflictingBooking &&
    $conflictingBooking->status === 'pending') {
    // ANY pending booking (admin or regular user) triggers waitlist
    $isPendingApprovalBooking = true;
}
```

**Key Change:** Removed the check for `$bookingUser->role === 'user'`. Now ANY pending booking triggers the waitlist, not just those from regular users.

### Change 2: Waitlist for any pending cart transaction

```php
// NEW CODE (FIXED)
foreach ($conflictingCartItems as $cartItem) {
    $cartTrans = $cartItem->cartTransaction;
    if ($cartTrans &&
        in_array($cartTrans->approval_status, ['pending', 'pending_waitlist'])) {
        // ANY user (admin or regular) with pending transaction triggers waitlist
        $isPendingApprovalBooking = true;
        $pendingCartTransactionId = $cartTrans->id;
        break;
    }
}
```

**Key Change:** Removed the check for `$cartTrans->user->role === 'user'`. Now ANY pending cart transaction triggers the waitlist.

## Testing the Fix

### Before Fix (Buggy Behavior)

```
1. Admin books slot → Booking #1 created (status: pending)
2. Regular user tries to book same slot
3. System checks if waitlist should trigger
4. Check fails because booking owner is admin (not regular user)
5. Result: "Waitlist Failed - One or more time slots are no longer available" ❌
```

### After Fix (Expected Behavior)

```
1. Admin books slot → Booking #1 created (status: pending)
2. Regular user tries to book same slot
3. System detects pending booking (regardless of owner role)
4. System adds user to waitlist
5. Response: "You have been added to the waitlist" ✅
6. Waitlist entry created in booking_waitlists table ✅
```

✅ PROCEED   ⏳ WAITLIST
(Admin      (Regular user
 override)   joins queue)
```

## Key Principles

1. **ANY pending booking triggers waitlist** - Whether the existing booking is from admin or regular user, new regular users should be waitlisted (not rejected)

2. **Admin privilege is to BYPASS waitlist** - Admins can book without being waitlisted themselves, but their pending bookings don't prevent others from joining the waitlist

3. **Only approved bookings block** - Only approved bookings (regardless of user role) should reject new booking attempts outright

4. **Waitlist is for ALL pending conflicts** - The role of the existing booking owner is irrelevant; what matters is the booking status (pending vs approved)

## Files Modified

- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/CartController.php` - Lines 224-248 (waitlist trigger logic)

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Admin Pending Booking (FIXED)
```bash
# Admin books a slot
POST /api/cart (as admin)
POST /api/cart/checkout (as admin)
# Result: Booking created with status='pending'

# Regular user tries to book same slot
POST /api/cart (as regular user)
# Expected: ⏳ Waitlisted
# Before fix: ❌ Rejected with "Waitlist Failed" (BUG!)
# After fix: ⏳ Waitlisted with position in queue (FIXED!)
```

### Scenario 2: Regular User Pending Booking (UNCHANGED)
```bash
# Regular user books a slot
POST /api/cart (as regular user)
POST /api/cart/checkout (as regular user)
# Result: Booking created with approval_status='pending'

# Another regular user tries to book same slot
POST /api/cart (as another regular user)
# Expected: ⏳ Waitlisted
# Result: ⏳ Waitlisted (WORKING)
```

### Scenario 3: Approved Booking (UNCHANGED)
```bash
# Any booking is approved
POST /api/cart-transactions/{id}/approve (as admin)

# Anyone tries to book same slot
POST /api/cart (as any user)
# Expected: ❌ Rejected
# Result: ❌ Rejected (WORKING)
```

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Run diagnostic
php debug-waitlist.php

# Run comprehensive test
php test-waitlist-fix.php

# Check for double bookings
php artisan tinker
>>> DB::select("
    SELECT b1.id as id1, b2.id as id2, b1.court_id, b1.start_time, b1.end_time
    FROM bookings b1
    INNER JOIN bookings b2 ON
        b1.court_id = b2.court_id AND
        b1.id < b2.id AND
        b1.status IN ('pending', 'approved') AND
        b2.status IN ('pending', 'approved') AND
        (
            (b2.start_time >= b1.start_time AND b2.start_time < b1.end_time) OR
            (b2.end_time > b1.start_time AND b2.end_time <= b1.end_time) OR
            (b2.start_time <= b1.start_time AND b2.end_time >= b1.end_time)
        )
");
```

## Impact

✅ **Fixes waitlist creation** - Users can now be waitlisted for any pending booking
✅ **Consistent behavior** - Booking status (not owner role) determines conflict handling
✅ **Clarifies admin privilege** - Admins bypass waitlist, but don't block others from waitlisting
✅ **No database changes required** - Pure logic fix

## Cleanup

After verifying the fix works, you can optionally remove the test scripts:

```bash
rm debug-waitlist.php
rm test-waitlist-fix.php
```

Or keep them for future debugging!
