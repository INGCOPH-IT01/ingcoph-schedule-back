# Booking Court Fix - Seeder Summary

## What Was Created

I've created **two database seeders** to fix existing booking data that wasn't updated when courts were changed before the bug fix was implemented.

### Files Created:

1. **FixBookingCourtsSeeder.php** ⭐ (Recommended)
   - Location: `database/seeders/FixBookingCourtsSeeder.php`
   - Uses efficient SQL queries
   - Shows preview before updating
   - Requires confirmation
   - Best for production use

2. **UpdateBookingCourtsFromCartItemsSeeder.php**
   - Location: `database/seeders/UpdateBookingCourtsFromCartItemsSeeder.php`
   - Uses Laravel Eloquent
   - More detailed logging
   - Better for debugging

3. **Documentation**
   - `docs/FIX_BOOKING_COURTS_SEEDER.md` - Complete guide
   - `FIX_COURT_MISMATCHES.txt` - Quick reference

## How to Run (Simple Version)

```bash
# 1. Go to backend folder
cd /Users/karloalfonso/Documents/GitHub/schedule/ingcoph-schedule-back

# 2. Run the seeder
php artisan db:seed --class=FixBookingCourtsSeeder

# 3. Review the preview and type "yes" to confirm
```

## What It Fixes

The seeder finds and fixes bookings where:
- The booking's `court_id` doesn't match its cart item's `court_id`
- This happened when admins changed a booking's court before the fix

**Example:**
- Admin changed Booking #145 from Court A to Court B
- `cart_items` table: ✅ Updated to Court B
- `bookings` table: ❌ Still showed Court A
- **Seeder fixes:** Updates booking to Court B

## Expected Output

```
Starting to fix booking court mismatches...
Found 15 booking(s) with court mismatches

Bookings to be updated:
+-----------+------------------+------------------+---------------------+--------------+
| Booking ID| Old Court        | New Court        | Start Time          | User         |
+-----------+------------------+------------------+---------------------+--------------+
| 145       | Court A (ID: 1)  | Court B (ID: 2)  | 2025-10-21 10:00:00 | John Doe     |
+-----------+------------------+------------------+---------------------+--------------+

Do you want to proceed with the update? (yes/no) [yes]:
> yes

Updating bookings...

=================================
Update Complete!
=================================
Bookings updated: 15
✓ All bookings are now in sync with their cart items!
```

## Safety Features

✅ Shows preview before making changes
✅ Requires confirmation
✅ Only updates active bookings (pending, approved, completed)
✅ Verifies fix after completion
✅ No syntax errors (validated)

## When to Run

Run this seeder if:
- You have bookings created before October 21, 2025
- Admins have changed courts on existing bookings
- You're seeing availability issues in the New Booking dialog
- You want to ensure data consistency

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Always backup your database first!**

```bash
# MySQL backup example
mysqldump -u your_username -p your_database > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

✅ **Test on staging first** if you have a staging environment

✅ **Run during low-traffic period** if running in production

## Verification

After running, verify by:
1. Checking the output shows "All bookings are now in sync"
2. Testing availability in the New Booking dialog
3. Checking a few bookings that were changed
