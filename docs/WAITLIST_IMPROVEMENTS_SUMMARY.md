# Waitlist System Improvements - Complete Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes two major improvements to the waitlist notification system:
1. **Business Hours Payment Deadline** - Fixed payment deadline calculation
2. **Parent Booking Approval Notifications** - Added notifications when parent bookings are approved

---

## 1. Business Hours Payment Deadline Fix

### Problem
When a parent booking was rejected between 5pm and next day 8am, the payment deadline was incorrectly calculated using simple hour addition (e.g., +48 hours), which didn't respect business hours.

### Solution
Implemented business hours logic that respects office hours (8am - 5pm, Monday-Saturday).

### Business Rules
| Rejection Time | Payment Deadline |
|---------------|------------------|
| During business hours (8am-5pm) | 1 hour from notification |
| After 5pm or before 8am | 9:00 AM next working day |
| On weekends/holidays | 9:00 AM next working day |

### Files Modified
- `app/Models/BookingWaitlist.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/CartTransactionController.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/BookingController.php`
- `resources/views/emails/waitlist-notification.blade.php`

### Documentation
See: `WAITLIST_PAYMENT_DEADLINE_FIX.md`

## 2. Parent Booking Approval Notifications

### Problem
When a parent booking was approved after being rejected:
- Waitlisted users who received auto-created bookings were not notified
- Their bookings remained pending without clear status
- Users attempted to upload payment for slots that were no longer available
- No communication about the cancellation

### Solution
When a parent booking is approved:
1. **Cancel all waitlist entries** for that time slot (both pending and notified)
2. **Automatically reject** any auto-created bookings for waitlisted users
3. **Send email notifications** to all affected waitlisted users
4. **Broadcast status changes** in real-time

### Email Content
The cancellation email now clearly states:
- ✅ Waitlist entry has been cancelled
- ✅ Parent booking was approved for another user
- ✅ Any auto-created booking will be rejected automatically
- ✅ No payment upload is needed
- ✅ Time slot details for reference

### Files Modified
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/CartTransactionController.php` (updated `cancelWaitlistUsers()`)
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/BookingController.php` (added `cancelWaitlistForApprovedBooking()`)
- `resources/views/emails/waitlist-cancelled.blade.php`

### Documentation
See: `WAITLIST_APPROVAL_NOTIFICATION.md`

## Complete Waitlist Flow

### Scenario A: Parent Booking Approved (No Rejection)
```
1. User A books Court 1, 10am-11am → Status: PENDING
2. User B joins waitlist → Status: PENDING
3. Admin approves User A's booking
   ├─→ User A's booking: APPROVED
   ├─→ User B's waitlist: CANCELLED
   └─→ Email sent to User B: "Slot no longer available"
```

### Scenario B: Parent Booking Rejected, Then Approved
```
1. User A books Court 1, 10am-11am → Status: PENDING
2. User B joins waitlist → Status: PENDING
3. Admin rejects User A's booking at 6pm
   ├─→ User A's booking: REJECTED
   ├─→ User B's waitlist: NOTIFIED (expires_at: next day 9am)
   ├─→ Auto-created booking for User B: PENDING
   └─→ Email to User B: "Upload payment by 9am tomorrow"

4. Admin approves User A's booking (reverses decision)
   ├─→ User A's booking: APPROVED
   ├─→ User B's waitlist: CANCELLED
   ├─→ User B's auto-booking: REJECTED
   ├─→ Real-time broadcast of status change
   └─→ Email to User B: "Waitlist cancelled, booking rejected"
```

### Scenario C: User Completes Payment Before Approval
```
1. User A books Court 1, 10am-11am → Status: PENDING
2. User B joins waitlist → Status: PENDING
3. Admin rejects User A's booking at 6pm
   ├─→ User B's waitlist: NOTIFIED (expires_at: next day 9am)
   ├─→ Auto-created booking for User B: PENDING
   └─→ Email to User B: "Upload payment by 9am tomorrow"

4. User B uploads payment at 8:30am next day
   └─→ User B's booking: PENDING (with payment proof)

5. Admin approves User A's booking (reverses decision)
   ├─→ User A's booking: APPROVED
   ├─→ User B's waitlist: CANCELLED
   ├─→ User B's booking: REJECTED (even though payment was uploaded)
   └─→ Email to User B: "Waitlist cancelled, booking rejected"
```

## Database Schema Reference

### booking_waitlists Table
```sql
- id (primary key)
- user_id (foreign key → users)

## Monitoring & Logs

### Key Log Events
```php
// Waitlist notification
'Waitlist auto-converted to booking'

// Waitlist cancellation
'Waitlist cancelled due to parent booking approval'

// Errors
'waitlist_cancellation_individual_error'
'waitlist_cancellation_error_on_booking_approval'
```

### Monitoring Queries

**Check recent waitlist activities:**
```sql
SELECT
    w.*,
    u.name as user_name,
    c.name as court_name
FROM booking_waitlists w
JOIN users u ON w.user_id = u.id
JOIN courts c ON w.court_id = c.id
WHERE w.updated_at > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 24 HOUR)
ORDER BY w.updated_at DESC;
```

**Check auto-rejected bookings:**
```sql
SELECT
    b.*,
    u.name as user_name
FROM bookings b
JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.id
WHERE b.notes LIKE '%Auto-rejected: Parent booking was approved%'
AND b.updated_at > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 24 HOUR);
```

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Payment deadline shows wrong time
- Check server timezone configuration
- Verify `BusinessHoursHelper` constants
- Check holiday table for unexpected entries

**Issue:** Cancellation emails not sent
- Check mail queue: `php artisan queue:work`
- Verify SMTP configuration
- Check Laravel logs for mail errors

**Issue:** Bookings not auto-rejected
- Verify booking notes contain "Auto-created from waitlist"
- Check `cancelWaitlistUsers()` is being called
- Review error logs for exceptions

**Issue:** Real-time updates not working
- Check WebSocket/Reverb connection
- Verify broadcasting configuration
- Test event broadcasting manually

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check queue jobs
php artisan queue:work --once

# Monitor logs in real-time
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep waitlist

# Check email queue
php artisan queue:failed

# Test email configuration
php artisan tinker
>>> Mail::raw('Test', function($msg) { $msg->to('test@example.com'); });
```

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries
- Waitlist lookups use indexed columns (court_id, start_time, end_time)
- Batch processing for multiple waitlist entries
- Eager loading of relationships to prevent N+1 queries

### Email Sending
- Emails sent asynchronously via queue
- Individual email failures don't block approval process
- Error handling prevents cascading failures

### Broadcasting
- Status changes broadcast only to relevant listeners
- Uses efficient WebSocket communication
- Reduces unnecessary HTTP requests
