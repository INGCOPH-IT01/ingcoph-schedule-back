# ✅ Complete Waitlist Solution - All Issues Resolved

## 🎯 Your Requirements

You asked for a waitlist system that:
1. ✅ Triggers for ANY pending booking (admin or regular user)
2. ✅ Saves the blocking booking ID
3. ✅ Saves cart items for waitlisted users
4. ✅ Auto-creates bookings when blocking booking is rejected
5. ✅ Sends email notifications asking for payment

## ✅ All Implemented!

### 1. Waitlist Triggers for ANY Pending Booking ✅

**Problem**: Waitlist only triggered for regular user bookings
**Solution**: Now triggers for ANY pending booking (admin or user)

```php
// CartController.php (Lines 232-238)
if ($conflictingBooking && $conflictingBooking->status === 'pending') {
    $isPendingApprovalBooking = true;
    $pendingBookingId = $conflictingBooking->id;  // ← Save blocking booking ID
}
```

### 2. Saves Blocking Booking ID ✅

**Problem**: Waitlist didn't know which booking was blocking it
**Solution**: Now saves `pending_booking_id` when creating waitlist

```php
// CartController.php (Lines 299-311)
$waitlistEntry = BookingWaitlist::create([
    'user_id' => $userId,
    'pending_booking_id' => $pendingBookingId,  // ← NEW! Links to blocking booking
    'pending_cart_transaction_id' => $pendingCartTransactionId,
    'court_id' => $item['court_id'],
    // ... other fields
]);
```

### 3. Saves Cart Items for Waitlisted Users ✅

**Problem**: Only waitlist entry was created, no cart items
**Solution**: Now creates both cart items AND waitlist entry

```php
// CartController.php (Lines 254-274)
// Create cart item for waitlisted slot
$cartItem = CartItem::create([
    'user_id' => $userId,
    'cart_transaction_id' => $cartTransaction->id,
    'court_id' => $item['court_id'],
    'booking_date' => $item['booking_date'],
    'start_time' => $item['start_time'],
    'end_time' => $item['end_time'],
    'price' => $item['price'],
    // ... other fields
]);
```

### 4. Auto-Creates Bookings on Rejection ✅

**Problem**: Users had to manually checkout after being notified
**Solution**: System automatically creates bookings when blocking booking is rejected

```php
// CartTransactionController.php (Lines 405-419)
// BookingController.php (Lines 1083-1096)
$newBooking = Booking::create([
    'user_id' => $waitlistEntry->user_id,
    'court_id' => $waitlistEntry->court_id,
    'sport_id' => $waitlistEntry->sport_id,
    'start_time' => $waitlistEntry->start_time,
    'end_time' => $waitlistEntry->end_time,
    'status' => 'pending',  // Awaiting payment
    'payment_status' => 'unpaid',
    'notes' => 'Auto-created from waitlist position #' . $waitlistEntry->position
]);
```

### 5. Sends Payment Notification Emails ✅

**Problem**: Users weren't notified properly
**Solution**: Sends email with 48-hour payment deadline

```php
// CartTransactionController.php & BookingController.php
$waitlistEntry->sendNotification(48);  // 48-hour deadline

Mail::to($waitlistEntry->user->email)
    ->send(new WaitlistNotificationMail($waitlistEntry, 'available'));
```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Step 1: Admin Books a Slot
├─ Booking #1 created (status: pending, user: admin)
└─ Slot is now occupied (but not yet approved)

Step 2: Regular User Tries to Book Same Slot
├─ System detects conflict with pending booking
├─ Creates Cart Transaction for user
├─ Creates Cart Item (saves court + time)
├─ Creates Waitlist Entry
│  ├─ pending_booking_id: 1  ← Links to admin's booking
│  ├─ position: 1
│  └─ status: 'pending'
└─ User sees: "You have been added to the waitlist"

Step 3: Admin Rejects the Booking
├─ Booking #1 marked as 'rejected'
├─ System finds all waitlist entries with pending_booking_id = 1
├─ For each waitlisted user:
│  ├─ Creates Booking #2 automatically
│  │  ├─ status: 'pending' (awaiting payment)
│  │  ├─ payment_status: 'unpaid'
│  │  └─ notes: 'Auto-created from waitlist position #1'
│  ├─ Marks waitlist as 'notified'
│  ├─ Sets 48-hour payment deadline
│  └─ Sends email: "Slot available! Upload payment within 48 hours"
└─ User receives email notification

Step 4: User Uploads Payment
├─ User uploads proof of payment
├─ Admin reviews and approves
├─ Booking #2 status → 'approved'
└─ Slot is now confirmed for the waitlisted user!
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test the Complete Flow

```bash
# 1. Admin books a slot
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/cart/checkout \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}" \
  -d '{"payment_method":"gcash"}'

# Result: Booking #1 created

# 2. Regular user tries to book same slot
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/cart \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {user_token}" \
  -d '{
    "items": [{
      "court_id": 1,
      "booking_date": "2025-10-24",
      "start_time": "10:00",
      "end_time": "11:00",
      "price": 500
    }]
  }'

# Result: Waitlist created with pending_booking_id = 1
# Expected response:
# {
#   "waitlisted": true,
#   "waitlist_entry": {
#     "pending_booking_id": 1,
#     "position": 1
#   },
#   "cart_item": { ... }
# }

# 3. Admin rejects the booking
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/cart-transactions/1/reject \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}" \
  -d '{"reason":"Schedule conflict"}'

# Result:
# - Booking #2 auto-created for waitlisted user
# - Email sent to user
# - 48-hour payment deadline set

# 4. Check database
mysql> SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE user_id = 2;
# Should show Booking #2 with:
# - status = 'pending'
# - payment_status = 'unpaid'
# - notes = 'Auto-created from waitlist position #1'

mysql> SELECT * FROM booking_waitlists WHERE user_id = 2;
# Should show:
# - status = 'notified'
# - notified_at = [current timestamp]
# - expires_at = [current timestamp + 48 hours]
```
