## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why Did This Happen?

The issue occurred because:

1. **Cart items were cancelled** after bookings were created
2. **Booking records were not updated** when cart items changed
3. **No automatic synchronization** existed between bookings and cart items

### Specific Scenario for Booking #46:

1. User/Admin created a booking for 16:00-18:00 with 2 cart items
2. Cart Item #156 (16:00-17:00) was later cancelled
3. The booking record still showed the original 16:00-18:00 time
4. Calendar view filters by active cart items, so it didn't show the booking

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

Created a new Laravel Artisan command: **`bookings:sync-cart-items`**

### Features:

✅ **Dry-run mode** (`--dry-run`) - Preview changes without applying
✅ **Fix mode** (`--fix`) - Apply corrections to database
✅ **Comprehensive checks:**
  - Detects cancelled cart items
  - Recalculates booking times from active items
  - Recalculates prices from active items
  - Cancels bookings with no active items
  - Provides detailed before/after reporting

### Usage:

```bash
# Preview what would be fixed
php artisan bookings:sync-cart-items --dry-run

# Apply fixes
php artisan bookings:sync-cart-items --fix
```

**Location:** `app/Console/Commands/SyncBookingsWithCartItems.php`

---

## 🔧 Recommendations

### 1. Run This Script Regularly

Add to cron/scheduler to run daily:

```php
// In app/Console/Kernel.php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    // Run booking sync check daily
    $schedule->command('bookings:sync-cart-items --fix')
             ->daily()
             ->at('02:00');
}
```

### 2. Update Cart Item Cancellation Logic

When a cart item is cancelled, automatically update the associated booking:

**File to update:** `app/Models/CartItem.php` or wherever cart items are cancelled

```php
// When cancelling a cart item, trigger booking sync
public function cancel() {
    $this->update(['status' => 'cancelled']);

    // Sync the associated booking
    if ($this->cartTransaction) {
        foreach ($this->cartTransaction->bookings as $booking) {
            if ($booking->court_id === $this->court_id) {
                $booking->syncWithCartItems();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Add Validation to Calendar Display

Ensure calendar views always cross-reference with active cart items:

**Frontend:** Check both booking record AND cart item status
**Backend API:** Filter bookings by active cart items in query
