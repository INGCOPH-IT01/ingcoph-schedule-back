## Data Inconsistencies

### üü° Minor Issues (4 false positives)

#### Time Range Validation Issue

**Cart Items:** #28, #32, #36, #137
**Issue:** Time slot 23:00:00 - 00:00:00 flagged as invalid
**Explanation:** These are legitimate midnight-crossing bookings. The validation logic in the analysis tool doesn't properly handle midnight (00:00:00) as the next day. This is **NOT a real data inconsistency** - the application correctly handles these bookings.

**Affected Bookings:**
- Cart Item #28: Court 1, 23:00-00:00 (Jasper shi)
- Cart Item #32: Court 2, 23:00-00:00 (Jasper shi)
- Cart Item #36: Court 3, 23:00-00:00 (Jasper shi)
- Cart Item #137: Court 4, 23:00-00:00 (Admin for Jasper shi)

**Resolution:** No action needed. The data is correct; the analysis validation logic needs to account for midnight crossings.

## Cross-Reference Analysis

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Booking-Transaction Reference Warning

**Issue:** 13 bookings reference cart transactions that weren't created on October 22.

**Explanation:** This is **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR**. The analysis scope was limited to transactions created on October 22, 2025, but bookings scheduled for October 22 may have been created (and their transactions recorded) on earlier dates.

**Example:**
- Booking #6-8 (Jasper shi) reference Transaction #5 (likely created earlier)
- Booking #43-45 (Raff Lim) reference Transactions #34-35 (created earlier)
- Booking #46-47 (Admin) reference Transaction #36 (created earlier)

**Resolution:** No action needed. This is normal when filtering by creation date versus booking date.
